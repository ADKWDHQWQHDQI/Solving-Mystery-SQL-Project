Oh boy, this is turning into a doozy of a mystery. Bruno was right all along!

For this part of the mystery, we're going to have to do something special. We're going to have to cross-reference data between 2 separate databases. That's crazy! How do we do that?



Not to worry, it's simpler than it sounds.  we need to add a new extension to our database and so we need to install it!

create extension dblink; -- run this to run queries across databases

**NOTE**
--> Make sure you are in the Same database while installing the extension, because extensions vary from database to database
